# Snap! Web Framework tutorial template

This template demonstrates the basic use of the Snap! web framework. It is also used as the starting point for the Snap! tutorial.

## Eclipse usage
* Install the Eclipse Gradle plugin
* Create a new workspace or create a new folder in your existing workspace.
* Copy this project to a folder to the new workspace/folder
* Import a new Gradle project using File -> import
* Once Eclipse has built the project open a shell and goto the workspace folder run the debug(unix/mac) or debug.bat(windows) scripts.

## Requirements
* Installed Gradle build system
* Java JRE 8 or JDK 8

## Running the example
Open a terminal session and go to the root folder of the project (where the `build.gradle` is). From there execute `gradle appRun`. This will start the project webserver. Now open your browser and go to [http://localhost:9100](http://localhost:9100)
